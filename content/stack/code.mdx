# Stacks

> Stack is a data structure where elements that enter last leave first. This is similar to a stack of books.
<<<<<<< HEAD
They are also known as, `LIFO`-**Last In First Out** or `FILO`-**First In Last Out**.

Stacks can be built using arrays or linkedlists. In this blog we will be using an array to build a stack.

The plain structure of Stack would look like this.

```java:Stacks.java
class stacks{
<<<<<<< HEAD
    int[] items;
=======
    private int[] items;
>>>>>>> 314da669bc445dc844f921c1e827f8542b22b19c
    private int count;
    private int capacity;

// Constructor for determining the size of the stack at the time of initialization
    public Stacks(int capacity){
<<<<<<< HEAD
        items = new int[capacity];
        this.capacity=capacity;
=======

        items = new int[capacity];
        this.capacity=capacity;

>>>>>>> 314da669bc445dc844f921c1e827f8542b22b19c
    }

    public void push(int value) {}

    public void pop() {}

<<<<<<< HEAD
    @Override
    public String toString() {}

    public boolean isEmpty {}

    public int peek() {}
}
```
Here `count` variable is the index of the top element.
=======
    public int peek() {}

    public boolean isEmpty() {}

    @Override
    public String toString() {}


}
```

- `count` variable is the index for the next element that enters.

- `items` is the array that our stack will be in.

- `capacity` is the variable that holds the length of array, this is optional but used it since it made my code clean

Lets look at `push` Method:

```java:push.java

/*
 * Time: O(1)
 * Space: O(1)
*/

// Adds an element on top of the stack

public void push(int value){
<<<<<<< HEAD
    items[count++]=value;
}
```
In the push method, it is also important to check if the stack is full, and output corresponding error message. When the stack runs out of space, there is no room left for elements to be added, resulting in stackoverflow. 

Following code can be used to address the exception.

```java:
      if(count==capacity) {
         throw new StackOverFlowError();
     }
```
=======

    if(count == capacity) // Since our stack length is full
        return;

    items[count++]=value;
}
```

While pushing just make sure that you check if the stack is full or no, and if not full then go further :).

Instead of stopping the execution by using return, you can use exception but I'll leave this friendly and not put any exceptions.

Lets look at `pop` method:

```java:pop.java

/*
 * Time: O(1)
 * Space: O(1)
*/

//Removes the top element

public int pop(){
<<<<<<< HEAD
    int temp = items[count]
=======

    if(count == 0) // No elements to pop
        // throw error so it doesn't go to the next step

    int temp = items[count - 1]
>>>>>>> 314da669bc445dc844f921c1e827f8542b22b19c
    items[count--] = 0;
    return temp;
}
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
This method is used to remove elements from the stack.

Similar to `push` method, it is important to check if the stack is empty, and output corresponding error message. When the stack is empty, there are no elements to be removed (there is no such element).

Following code can be used to address the exception

```java:
      if(count==0) {
         throw new NoSuchElementException();
     }
```


=======

This method is used to remove elements from the stack.

Similar to `push` method, it is important to check if the stack is empty, and you can use exception here as well.

Lets look at `peek` Method:

```java:peek.java

/*
 * Time: O(1)
 * Space: O(1)
*/

// Returns the top element in the stack

public int peek(){
<<<<<<< HEAD
    return items[count-1];
}
```
Peek and pop are kinda similar, where both methods target the top element of the stack. But the major difference is that, peek returns the element on the top of the stack, whereas pop removes the element on the top from the stack.
=======

    if(count == 0)
        return; // throw err.

    return items[count-1];
}
```

Peek and pop are kinda similar, where both methods target the top element of the stack.
But the major difference is that, peek returns the element that's on the top of the stack and `doesn't remove the element`, whereas pop removes the element on the top from the stack.

Lets look at `isEmpty` Method

```java:isEmpty.java

/*
 * Time: O(1)
 * Space: O(1)
*/

public boolean isEmpty(){
<<<<<<< HEAD
    return count==0;
}
```
=======
    return count == 0;
}
```

>>>>>>> 314da669bc445dc844f921c1e827f8542b22b19c
This method can be used to check if the stack is empty. It returns true when count value is zero.

Lets look at `toString` Method:

<<<<<<< HEAD
```java:toString
=======
```java:toString.java
>>>>>>> 314da669bc445dc844f921c1e827f8542b22b19c

/*
 * Time: O(n)
 * Space: O(n)
*/

@Override
public String toString(){
<<<<<<< HEAD
    var values = Arrays.copyOfRange(items,0,count); 
    
    // Did this way to show you that this method exists. Using a traditional for loop would allow you to achieve this method in O(1) space complexity.
=======
    var values = Arrays.copyOfRange(items,0,count);

    // This method makes a for loop and generates a new array, which results in a O(n) space.

    // Did this way to show you that this method exists.
    // Using a traditional for loop would allow you to achieve this method in O(1) space complexity.
>>>>>>> 314da669bc445dc844f921c1e827f8542b22b19c

    return Arrays.toString(values)
}
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
This method is useful for printing the stack.

=======

Method just for printing the stack

> If you read till here, you question can we just use a linked list? cuz that's the same thing going around my mind now, there is no harm in using a linked list
