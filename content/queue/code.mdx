# Queue Code

<<<<<<< HEAD
> Queue is a data structure where elements that enter first leaves first. They are also known as 
`LILO` - **Last In Last out** or `FIFO` - **First In First Out**

An analogy can be shopping queue ðŸ˜‰.

The basic **structure** of queue would look like this:

  // You can add more methods but I think this much will be enough for now.
}
```

Alright lets look at the global variables before we go front.

- `queue` array is an array that holds all the elements in it.

<<<<<<< HEAD
- `length` it a variable that holds the current length of the queue, this is required since doing **queue.length** returns us the array length and not the number of elements thats inside the queue.

- `front` is a variable that holds the first element index in the circular array.

- `rear` is the variable that holds the (last element index) + 1 in the circular array.

- `capacity` is the variable that is given by the constructor to instantiate the array with a size.

Now that we have understood what each variable is doing, we can look at basic methods in it.

Firstly lets look at the basic method `enqueue`:

```java:enqueue.java
  public void enqueue(int value) {

    if (length == queue.length)
      return;

    // You can throw exceptions if you wish to, but I want to keep this friendly and
    // just return it

    length++;
    queue[rear] = value;
    rear = (rear + 1) % capacity;
  }
```

In this method, we just add another element into our queue and increment rare with one.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Our next method is `dequeue`:

```java:dequeue.java
  public void dequeue() {
    if (length == 0)
      return;

    // Similarly you can throw exception here as well
    // Java is full of errors so keep throwing exceptions when you can ðŸ˜‰

    length--;
    queue[front] = 0;
    front = (front + 1) % capacity;
  }
```

In this method we just remove an element from the array, and increase front to the next element index.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Suppose you want to know which element in the first, we use a method called `peek`:

  }
```

Another simple method is isEmpty to check if the queue is empty or no.

Printing a circular array might be tricky so don't feel bad if you don't get it.

```java:toString.java

@override
  public String toString() {
    String str1 = "";

    for(int i = front; i < queue.length ; i++){
      str += queue[i];
    }

    String str2 = "";

    for(int i = rear; i < front; i++){
      str += queue[i];
    }

    return str1 + str2;
  }

```
